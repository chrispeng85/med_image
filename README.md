A pytorch implementation of ensemble model training including three vision models(ResNet50, efficientnet_b0, ViT_b_16). The model is trained on knee osteoarthritis image datasets (three classes: Normal, Osteopenia, Osteoporosis), using a remote instance of RTX3080 in a linux environment hosted by Prime Intellect.
