A pytorch implementation of ensemble model training including three vision models(ResNet50, efficientnet_b0, ViT_b_16). The model is trained on knee osteoarthritis image datasets (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fuyadhasanbhoyan/knee-osteoarthritis-classification-224224/data), using a remote instance of RTX3080 in a linux environment hosted by Prime Intellect. The model scores an average of 80-82% on test datasets.
